Recursion Notes:
1: You can do things while going deep into recursion or while comming back.
(Write program to print 5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5)
2: If you are collecting results in collection then no need to return 
if not DO NOT FORGET to return
3: For loop can be converted into recursion and vice versa.
4: DO NOT FORGET to return from the program. Always check on that.
(Do reverse linked list program)
